Unfortunately, toyota will only repaint the parts peeling activly and as time goes on more and more peels so idk how many times I'll need work done. Then, my car makes a horrible grinding/squeeling noise on start up. I've had 3 trips to toyota and the service hears the sound when I take it in and they verify they hear it on file but they then deny hearing it during actual service probably because they have no idea whats going on. Since the car functions it's unlikely lemon laws apply currently. Toyota makes really good engines because unlike American manufacrues they don't care to be \"innovative\" for the sake of change they build what works. Unfortunately, their transmission are still CVT which is what I suspect is making the noise. Toyota about 10 years ago had a MASSIVE problem with frame rot on various models of vehicle. Not really their fault the frame treatment was outsourced but it happened and it cost them billions if I'm not mistaken on the dollar amount. Toyota and Honda are better than American manufacturers but they've had serious issues too and currently are having issues with transmissions. I'm in a toyota group and alot of guys have their CVT shit the bed under 60k miles. If I had to choose I would still pick toyota or Honda over GM and Ford though\nREPLY 4 (3): I see well that sucks man hopefully you can get everything worked out with them. I\u2019ll have to look into some of those things see what people are thinking thanks for the head ups\nREPLY 4 (2): I've found that more expensive models sometimes have much greater reliability than cheaper models. Not always, but definitely true for items like CVTs. Stay away!\n\nI have a 2001 PT Cruiser, but I was lucky because this one somehow must've been manufactured very well. It has never had any major issues.\n\nAlso, proven technology (and hopefully good other items like paint, unfortunate in this case) combined with good maintenance should last a very long time with any car manufacturer honestly, but Toyota and Honda are probably top Tier there long as it doesn't have a CVT or other cheap assemblies.\nREPLY 5 (2): You'd be surprised how often the opposite is true depending on manufacture. American manufactures tend to put newer technology with higher end cars. The later mustang a year or two ago started having engine problems. Idk if Ford ever recalled them after all I heard they did. And as far as the CVT they're actually getting put in toyotas newer vehicles more frequently.\nREPLY 4 (1): That sounds like maybe a variable valve actuator issue. Pretty common on Hondas as well.\nREPLY 5 (1): I thought so too but it's more of a squeel grind then a rattle. I checked all the belts and those were fine too. It only happens on start up for like 2 seconds but it sounds horrible. Pretty sure it's going to cost me sooner or later\nREPLY 4 (1): I believe the Corolla still optionally comes with a manual transmission, I bet with a manual it would be much better\nREPLY 5 (1): Yeah I think they still offer it\nREPLY 1 (1): agreed, so many games are being played these days"}]}

He's beat it to all hell, driven it through wild fires, snow, torrential rain, doesn't garage it, and takes it off roading every single weekend and it doesn't bat an eye.\nREPLY 2 (14): Second this. Savagegeese did a great video on them iirc\nREPLY 2 (3): Toyota 4 Runner\nREPLY 2 (1): Even better, the Nissan Patrol.\nREPLY 1 (37): Land cruisers would be good bets. They are all around where I live.\nREPLY 2 (32): If you're in the US it's gonna have to be the LX because you can't buy new ones anymore unless it's unsold stock.\nREPLY 3 (21): My LC got close to 400k miles and still was driving perfectly with no issues. Best car I\u2019ve ever had easily.\nREPLY 4 (8): I bought a 2015 Toyota tundra with the 4.6L hoping it would fall into this category.  Would you say it would?\nREPLY 5 (10): The million mile Tundra had a 4.6.\nREPLY 5 (7): With good maintenance, the Tundra should last a long time\nREPLY 5 (6): Not like a LC.  25 year *hard* service life vs 15 year service life.  The 4Runner is good for 300k miles.  I\u2019d say the Tundra is more like 2-250,000."}]}

I think the Camry is still known for being reliable as well but im not too sure.\nREPLY 1 (5): might be good to avoid XREAS suspension if you're in it for the long haul. It's a closed system, and when one goes bad, I think at least a side or the whole system has to be replaced. I really wouldn't mind that better on pavement performance (my SR5 has annoying body roll), but apparently owners report that when it goes bad (and some go bad before 100k miles), it's 3 grand or more fix to replace. I am talking out of ass, though, so if you're wondering, google XREAS and 4runner, or watch the car care nut on youtube for this topic. That said, I wouldn't be sad if I had it on my 4runner, I'd be happy and probably just get an extended warranty, or replace with some other upgraded suspension when they go.\nREPLY 1 (0): 4runners are project vehicles after 150k miles.  They just start to fall apart."}]}
