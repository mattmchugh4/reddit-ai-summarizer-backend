When there are lots of devs on the street, as there are right now, the cost to hire them naturally goes down.\nREPLY 1 (86): Little nit, you\u2019re talking about supply and demand. Cost of labor is a line item in expenses spreadsheets\nREPLY 2 (100): This comment legit sounds like a comment I would see in a code review.\nREPLY 3 (23): How about\n\n\"try this: (link to God knows where)\"\n\n*no further elaboration*\nREPLY 4 (20): Try giving this a shot: https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science\nREPLY 4 (13): At least that provides an alternative, some comments I received was just \"Not sure if this approach is good\" and nothing else.\nREPLY 2 (5): Well, true in a sense, but in this context, I'm referring to how many people think salaries relate to the cost of living. They 100% do not.\nThey are driven solely by the cost of a different person to fill that seat. And in compensation terms, we refer to that as cost of labor.\u00a0\nIn software, there is effectively zero marginal cost of labor involved in production. That \"cost of labor\" is under \"r&d\", not COGS.\u00a0\nREPLY 3 (1): Cost of labor can decrease due to a variety of factors, not just supply and demand forces. For example offshoring can decrease cost of labor while still paying market rates (the catch is just that it's the market rate of a different country). Someone quitting half way through a project could also affect cost of labor. So salaries aren't driven by cost of labor, it's the other way around: when you do the accounting, you add up compensation numbers in order to compute the value for cost of labor.\n\nI do agree with the overall point though, that more supply decreases prices, this is a well documented phenomenon.\nREPLY 4 (4): That's still supply and demand.\nWhen we talk about salary bands and cost of labor, in management, budgeting and recruiting, we're talking about competitive cost to put butts in seats. When lots of. People are competing for that seat, salaries go down.\u00a0\nREPLY 2 (5): Nit to the nit, I don\u2019t think there was anything wrong with OP\u2019s original statement. Salaries are indeed driven by the cost of labour, which is affected by supply and demand as OP illustrated in the next sentence.\nREPLY 3 (7): Let's block this action item pending a meeting to discuss this.\nREPLY 2 (1): I was thinking the same lol like of course salary is cost of labor.\nREPLY 1 (3): NO!!!! *FERAL NOISES** SWEs WILL ALWAYS BE WORTH 300K PER YEAR, HOW ELSE IS A COMPANY SUPPOSED TO CENTER THEIR DIV **SCREEEEEE**\nREPLY 1 (1): Yes, it's definitely noticeable. Many companies are cutting salaries, likely due to market conditions, but the high number of applicants shows how competitive the job market has become. \n\nIt's tough out there for job seekers right now."}]}

In most of the economy, *inflation adjusted wages* are up since 2019. \n\nIs it also the case for software engineering? Because not accounting for the 30% to 40% inflation that's happened since 2019 is not useful. Your compensation could be up from 2019 but still significantly down relative to inflation.\nREPLY 2 (2): This is correct. If we zoom out though, the compensation at big tech type companies was insane and way higher than any comparable job, and even now with the mentioned inflation, the compensation is ... insane and way higher than any comparable job. So I'm not surprised that there's a bit of a rubber band effect going on and tech salaries are not keeping up with the rest of the economy. Software engineers just have so much more room to fall than truck drivers\nREPLY 2 (4): Where has the inflation been 30% to 40% from 2019 to now?\nREPLY 3 (2): Yeah, inflation is only ~23% in that time period. That said, rent, most grocery items, restaurant prices, and other reference points one commonly uses when thinking about cost of living have increased faster than inflation for seperate reasons which has a similar impact to inflation having been higher.\nREPLY 4 (2): \"only\"\nREPLY 2 (1): That's a good question, I don't have the numbers. From a practical perspective though, inflation isn't the scariest of boogiemen. You're gonna buy eggs regardless of whether they're up 2% or 20%. Personally, the number I look at that I think is both very important and unequivocally more grim is house prices. Compensation definitely has not kept up on that front, hence why boomers often sound so out of touch w/ the realities of younger people today.\nREPLY 1 (32): Idk, I'd say it's similar but the requirements are different and the dollar has inflated. When I graduated in 2018, the average junior position was $50k-$120k depending on company and location. FAANG was like $160k ($110k/120k base). Now, if you can even find a junior role, they're like $50k-$120k (which is now worth 30% less than it was in 2018 from inflation), but require 2 YOE in something like data analytics, IT, frontend, or DevOps/Support. FAANG don't even seem to extend junior roles to their interns anymore.\n\nFor context, my first role was $65k/yr and my company doesn't even hire for that contributor level anymore. Instead they pay $15k-25k/yr for a similar role in India.\nREPLY 2 (12): I mean to be fair practically almost no other field had that high of salaries right out of school with just a bachelors degree.\n\nI think expecting that market to remain the same is a little ridiculous. The days of the average cs grad getting 90-100k out of school are over. Market saturation was bound to happen with those opportunities. \n\nMost majors, including other engineering fields, start at way lower salaries. 50-70k if that.\nREPLY 3 (-2): I went to a top-n university where modt students are try hards trying to maximize income right after graduation. Everyone was going for a minimum of 120k+ in my social circle and mostly landed in finance and tech, with the most insane becoming quants or getting offers at major hedge funds. Personally landed a job as a data scientist with total comp at 150k in fiance.\n\nAnyway, I was surprised to learn that a friend from high school who went to state school and graduated in 2 years with a nursing degree makes the same as me. With overtime, these nursing salaries are insane. Healthcare seems like a prime industry for labor going forward.\n\nAlso, another relevant anecdote - when applying to data science roles, I felt there were a ton that asked explicitly for bioinformatics experience. I think in the future, there will be a bit of a boom in the field, especially with how good we are getting at genome sequencing.\nREPLY 4 (24): I mean nursing salaries are supply and demand. \n\nThe job fucking sucks. It\u2019s not even comparable to being any sort of engineer. We sit on our asses all fucking day. The job isn\u2019t that hard.\n\nBeing a nurse SUCKS. You\u2019re on your feet all day. People will spit, vomit, and literally be violent towards you. Patients are brutal. \n\nSo no, nursing salaries aren\u2019t \u201cinsane\u201d they just are in line with how valuable they are to society and how little nurses there are compared to openings.\n\nAnd given the difference in the job conditions, I never see that changing tbh. And good. I hope nurses get paid.\nREPLY 5 (4): 16 years in engineering and I can confirm that I have rarely been vomit or shit on at work. But neither are actually never\u2026\nREPLY 5 (1): Ramit did a podcast episode talking to a couple where the wife/gf was a covid nurse. She was making a ton of money, but burned out hard, and the experience scarred her. Can't remember if she's still a nurse, or completely switched fields, but that high pay wasn't worth it to her for what she witnessed.\nREPLY 5 (1): Not to mention all the traumatizing death and gore they see on a weekly basis.\nREPLY 5 (-1): I wasn't trying to make a point about what nurses should or shouldn't be making, I was simply giving an example of a career that was as well compensated as software enginering, especially when you consider the opportunity cost of not needing as much schooling generally.\nREPLY 4 (1): Bioinformatics is hitting its peak at the moment. I think it's hand-in-hand with what you're experiencing, not a predictor\nREPLY 5 (1): I don't think this is the peak, but admittedly I am biased to what I was told by the professor of a computational biology class I took, and he seemed to believe that insurance companies would start assigning rates based on your DNA within 10 years among other things\nREPLY 4 (1): > Anyway I was surprised to learn that a friend from higschool who went to state school and graduated in 2 years with a nursing degree makes the same as me.\n\nThere's some nuance there though. A two year nursing degree means they are stuck as a registered nurse and may be close to their earning cap assuming they aren't a travel nurse. Meanwhile we both know the ceiling for data scientists is *much* higher than $150k while working a standard 9-5.\nREPLY 5 (3): They aren't \"stuck,\" they can always go back for more education.\nREPLY 5 (1): 1. I'm pretty sure it's a regular nursing degree she just graduated early. don't know the details.\n\n2. yeah obviously my job is preferable, not only for the earning potential but it's also just much easier.\nREPLY 3 (-1): lawyers need 3 more years of school but can make 200k+ starting out.\nREPLY 4 (3): That\u2019s only big law\nREPLY 4 (4): Most don\u2019t though and law school is triple the cost compared to undergrad and it\u2019s extremely competitive to get into a decent firm. Next.\nREPLY 2 (1): >my company doesn't even hire for that contributor level anymore.\n\nI wonder if this will play to the favor of those of us already in that role or higher: if they're not hiring juniors anymore, a few years down the road there will be a serious lack of qualified candidates in the mid-senior level to replace those retiring, making way for higher compensation to those of us current juniors/mids who got in before the recession, and who have by then developed senior skills. Just thought I'd leave something optimistic on Reddit tonight to see what happens \ud83d\ude0a\nREPLY 1 (2): Anecdotally, it still looks lower than 2019 from where I\u2019m sitting. In nominal dollars even, not inflation adjusted."}]}
