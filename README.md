A full-stack project showcasing an AI-powered Reddit thread summarization tool. The frontend, built with Next.js (App Router), delivers real-time responses via WebSocket communication and the ChatGPT API's streaming capabilities. The backend, a Flask application, handles the AI processing and is deployed on Railway.
