[[COMMENT (21): Right now nothing that is 3 years old is a good deal, my Toyota dealer seriously just sold a 3 year old Tacoma with 34k miles for $3k more than it’s original MSRP because he had it on the lot., REPLY 1 (4): No kidding. My parents had a 2 year old 4Runner (18k miles) that they just traded in for 4k above what they bought it for.], [COMMENT (11): The Ford maverick. Its starts at $19,995 (plus shipping charges like any car), comes standard with decent options and standard with a hybrid powertrain that gives it roughly 40mpg. \n\nIts the cheapest pickup truck you can buy AND the cheapest hybrid you can buy, not even a Toyota Corolla Hybrid is as inexpensive. \n\nFords also been using this hybrid powertrain for a while and seems to have the kinks worked out. Even fully loaded theyre a decent value., REPLY 1 (1): The few being offered near me are selling for $5-7K above list. \n\nFirst year Ford, plus that much in pure sunk cost, makes one a very bad deal. Fords launches of new models in the past 4-5 years have been really messy, with multiple recalls.\n\nIm open to buying a 2023 at no more than list price., REPLY 2 (3): The powertrain in the maverick isnt new so it shouldnt be very troublesome despite being a new model. No car is worth paying over msrp, id wait until the dealers fuck off with that shit., REPLY 3 (2): Ford seems to have messed up vehicle launches with carryover powertrains as well, such as with composite removable roofs on the Bronco.\n\nAgree on paying over MSRP, its a financial debacle waiting to happen in case of a wreck or theft., REPLY 4 (2): Well the maverick doesnt have anything that ford isnt used to doing. When was the last time they built a wrangler competitor?], [COMMENT (21): Any heavily depreciated 3 year old premium executive sedan like a 7-series, an A8, or an S-Class would be your best bang for the buck. As new cars theyre terrible value, but when you can get a 3 year old 7-series for the same price as a Toyota Highlander they suddenly become a bargain., REPLY 1 (25): You will still be paying bills for a car costing 100k+ and that’s kinda where people get fucked hard, high end luxury cars are not just about owning, you need to maintain them too so it is not always a bargain., REPLY 2 (5): Paying $10-20k in maintenance and repairs is ALOOOOT less than paying the $40k+ in depreciation these cars often times see in their first few years, ESPECIALLY if you plan to drive the car into the ground, it makes no financial sense to lose the depreciation at its steepest point and deal with the repairs, might as well buy lightly used and heavily depreciated and deal with the upkeep costs. \n\nIt also helps if you buy models with true and tested motors/transmissions that have a decent reputation.  For example a BMW 7 series with the N55 3.0L I6 turbo motor and 8 speed ZF transmission is actually pretty reliable and likely to be worth owning until around 200k miles whereas a 7 series with the N63 (iirc) TT V8 motor is guaranteed to cost you atleasts $10-20k more in repairs than the I6. Getting something like a newly designed hybrid powertrain thats only been out for a few years is just begging for trouble. \n\nOr getting something like a Lexus LS series (even though its barely a luxury car in comparison to a 7 series/S class) or the newer Genesis isnt a bad idea for long term running costs., REPLY 2 (6): Lexus LS is an exception. I’m biased, REPLY 1 (6): [deleted], REPLY 2 (1): But what are the chances youll have to deal with anywhere close in repairs to the $38k you saved in depreciation?, REPLY 3 (1): I think its more a out why not buy a 3 year old Ford get some money saved on depreciation without the potential high repair costs. But all cars nowadays seem expensive to repair, REPLY 1 (8): Hell no, those cars are halfway towards 5-6 k repair. Any Highlander is better than owning a 7 series.], [COMMENT (6): I\ve bought and sold over 32 cars and never lost money on any of them. Yup. Currently loving My 2012 ttrs with 41k km, my 2008 135i Msport with 95k km and my 97 prelude SH with 110k all manual.\n\nAll are tuned, I\ve fixed regular components requiring maintenance on all 3 cars myself, save one time I got someone to do the brakes on my bmer because I just didn\t have the time. if you\re somewhat mechanical and can use youtube and the internet you\ll surprise yourself on what you are capable of. \n\n3 years or less? If you just want something boring, depends where you are. Funny how people lump brands and aren\t telling you specific models. \n\nIf you live in canada or somewhere it snows, you can get a great deal on RWD cars. Even better if you\re looking at a model that has a shiny new better version (older v6 stinger is prob your best bet, even the awd one, looks better imo, fast AF and not cheap from any angle inside or out). If you don\t mind the look of the outgoing genesis counterpart you should find it at a good price too. \n\nIf you\re in California Texas or Florida, or other places it doesn\t snow, you\ll get a steal on 4wd cars and suvs. I have driven my cars over 30 hours just to have the specific model / options I wanted. I\ve even had them trucked/freight trained to me.\n\nDo not get base models, they just suck in every way. In my experience, I\d rather have a well equipped accord rather than a base bmw even if maintenance was included. \n\nCars you could get great deals on regardless where you are, the last model FRS/BRZ, first iteration of the mkv supra (although I\ve heard the 2021 MY ecu is unchippable at the moment, doubt that will stay that way and people will tune the latest MY supra, so this gives the 1st year realeased models a slight advantage, just because it had less hp and a a less amazing tuned suspension, but it\s still a supra and you\ll likely get a deal on it, and it will still be better than most cars out there at that price point.\n\nMy family friend picked up the benz sl500 for almost 35% off brand new... its ugly to me, not my thing, old, outdated, but hey the 90s sl500 is one of my fav cars and beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder. Older model GTI\s should be decently priced, I prefer the look of the mk7, it was too refined for the way I drive but still a great car (Jeremy Clarkson has a permanent hard-on for this car, for good reason). \n\nLike I said before, stinger gt (v6, awd or rwd depending where you get it from) if I was you I would get this, I also wouldn\t get the first Gen supra only because so many improvements have been made and it\s one of the cars on my list of must haves so I\d get the newer one but still, will be tough to find a car with better performance at that price. Hope this helps! Good luck! Have fun in the process, and if you\re a car guy, or want to smile every time you drive, make sure you like what you pick.\n\nLmk what you end up with], [COMMENT (9): > **What’s the best bang for your buck cars** that are at most 3 years old?\n\nThose with the greatest number of miles. Also, you can check this list of greatest depreciaters: https://www.iseecars.com/cars-that-hold-their-value-study\n\nAs we can see, the greatest depreciaters are also the junkiest cars (BMW, Volvo, Audi, etc.). A better strategy would be to buy new from among the lowest depreciaters, or buy an ultra-high-mile 3-year-old used vehicle from, say, Toyota or Lexus., REPLY 1 (9): Completely disagree. You say BMW, Volvo and Audi are junk cars but when you browse forums, you can see that recent models (2016 or more recent) owners have very little to complain about.\n\nThis is because almost every major auto maker makes use of modularity, meaning they re-use the same engine, transmissions and platforms across their models.\n\nThis means that, while there\s less variety (thinking of the 2.0T EA888 engine found in not only almost every Audi, but every Volkswagen as well), there\s more reliability, for obvious reasons. Could you imagine the single or select few couple of engines that a whole brand uses for ALL their cars was unreliable? Everyone would know about it.\n\nBut, obviously, that\s not the case. Modular engines are reliable. VW\s 2.0T or 3.0T are reliable, BMW\s inline 4 and inline 6 engines are reliable. And this is even more so because they\re based on their previous generation engines and models. For example, BMW\s B series engines are based on the previous N series engines. And Audi\s engines are basically on the same block for a decade or more.\n\nI disagree with your comment because you do what almost everyone on this sub does, which is just, oh European luxury are bad, unreliable, junky or whatever else.\n\n\nNo. Right now, buying a 3-year old Audi, BMW or Volvo is a better decision than it EVER was, you can get a 3-year old Audi with 30k miles on it, drive it until it has 60-70k easily with any issues, and sell it (for obviously much less money, but that\s not the point of OP\s post)., REPLY 2 (10): https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2021/11/18/consumer-reports-most-reliable-cars-trucks-suvs/6385214001/\n\n###Here is the 2022 Consumer Reports Auto Reliability Report rankings of major automotive brands:\n\n1.
