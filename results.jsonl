That stuff needs to happen, alot.\nREPLY 1 (80): It helps if you maintain a cool disposition. Maintain the appropriate level of eye contact at all costs. \nREPLY 2 (67): I don't know what the appropriate level is! I usually avoid eye contact in daily life and then I feel bold and try to give eye contact and they look at my eyes and I panic and look at my feet... :(\n\nIf I look at them, I feel like they'll think I'm trying to stare them down or that I'm obsessed with them or something...\nREPLY 3 (46): You can look away any time there's a natural break in the conversation or you gather your thoughts. And you should, just don't stare at your feet. Glance at the objects on their desk, or the pictures behind their chair. Keep your attention focused on the room you're in. \n\nThe goal isn't to stare. Eye contact shows you're giving them full attention, especially while you're answering questions, otherwise you will appear evasive and dishonest.\n\nYou don't have to look them straight in the eyes all the time. Look at their nose, look slightly above their nose, as long as you are generally looking at their face they won't notice the difference.\nREPLY 4 (57): To really freak them out, trying staring at an imaginary point behind their eyes\nREPLY 5 (46): THEN you'll see the sailboat.\nREPLY 5 (2): Or stare directly at their right ear the ENTIRE time.\nREPLY 5 (1): ...into their soul!\nREPLY 4 (4): One thin to note is to try and keep your gaze within the triangle of the 2 eyes and mouth.  If you look above their eyes it is very disconcerting.  Try it with a friend.\nREPLY 5 (1): Ah, you're right. Damn. So much for staring at eyebrows.\nREPLY 4 (1): Looking at the point between the two eyes can be disconcerting for some people, however. \nREPLY 4 (1): Best thing is to stare at one ear, it looks like you are half cross-eyed and staring off into space. HILARIOUS. Try it. Do it.\nREPLY 5 (1): Sounds amazing...\nREPLY 3 (2): > I don't know what the appropriate level is!\n\nIf you're never breaking eye contact, that's too much.\n\nIf you never look at their eyes at all, that's too little.\n\nAnything in between should work!\nREPLY 3 (2): Try using more hand gestures and glance at your hands as you do so. It'll look very normal and keep yours and their eyes distracted. Another thing you could do is look at their gestures as they do it. \nREPLY 4 (1): Why hadn't I thought of any of these things? This seems like a thing I could do pretty easily.\nREPLY 3 (2): My roommate and I always make eye contact with random people around campus and just hold it until they look away. Not sure why but its kinda fun. Starts to get weird when noone looks away after about 5 seconds though\nREPLY 4 (1): Haha jesus you're frightening people. \nREPLY 3 (2): Best rule i learned about public speaking, and it applies to interviews as well - if you absolutely feel uncomfortable with direct eye contact, stare at their eyebrows or foreheads for longer distances\nREPLY 4 (1): That actually sounds like a good trick as long as it's a decent distance between you. Cheers.\nREPLY 3 (2): I find it works if I hold eye contact until they break it, at which point I also look away for a  little bit, and wait until they are looking at me again (I will occasionally glance to check) before I look back.\nREPLY 3 (1): Just keep eye contact if they are trying to simple as that.\nREPLY 3 (0): See Marco Rubio's recent rebuttal to the SOTU.\n\nEDIT: C'mon guys, didn't you see him staring at the camera like a nervous puppy while diving off screen for the water bottle?\nREPLY 2 (2): You mean the death stare doesn't work?\nREPLY 2 (1): Was going to say the same thing, too much eye contact is creepy, not enough eye contact can also be bad. Just act normal, talk to them like you have been working with them for months. \nREPLY 2 (1): ALOT http://i.imgur.com/8YXRIJN.gif\nREPLY 1 (22): But don't stare too much. No into their souls kind of thing.\nREPLY 2 (2): And for the love of god don't jack off while staring at the interviewer.\nREPLY 2 (2): But Jedi mind tricks are still cool, right?\nREPLY 3 (3): I am the applicant you are looking forrrrrrrr.\nREPLY 2 (1): I'm glad you brought that up, I feel like I tend to focus on eye contact *too* much to the point where it's unnatural and I'm consciously thinking about it.  Do you have any advice for that?\nREPLY 3 (1): When they're talking, you look. When you're talking or before that, you can break contact and you can pretend you're thinking deeply about the question. But every now and then you look back, especially when you're about to finish. General things like that, it takes experience and gradually it becomes natural.\nREPLY 1 (37): [ALOT](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S8TRIo4br3I/AAAAAAAACv4/Zh7_GcMlRKo/s400/ALOT.png)\nREPLY 1 (2): Yes. And if you're facing a panel, remember to spread the love. Start by looking at the person who asked you the question. As you answer, move to look in turns at the different people in the panel. Then finish your answer back at the person who asked you the question.\n\nAnd if possible, smile (don't force it though).\nREPLY 1 (2): If you're super shy and have issues looking people directly in the eye, look at their eyebrows. This was what my highschool choir teacher had us do durring competitions. Making eye contact with your judge during a solo was extremely important.\nREPLY 1 (2): Alot has trouble with eye contact, leave him alone.\nREPLY 1 (1): Eye contact and a good firm hand shake work wonders in an interview.\nREPLY 1 (1): I think there is a cultural distinction though, I have know some of my bosses/ interviews seem to to get angry with you when you make eye contact with them.\nREPLY 1 (1): Well, also there theres such a thing as *too much* eye contact.\nREPLY 1 (1): Eye contact can be seen as a threat to their dominance. Look at the bridge of their noise, it shows that they maintain dominance while at the same time portraying yourself as powerful. \nREPLY 1 (1): www.thatme.me/alot\nREPLY 1 (1): As someone with Asperger's Syndrome... *fuck.*\n\nYou're right though, it is important. Too little is bad, too much is bad.\nREPLY 2 (1): Look at their eyebrows or nose instead, if direct eye contact makes you nervous. 3-5 seconds before glancing away, then back.\nREPLY 1 (1): A tip I have learned for eye contact is to actually look at their forehead, from a distance of 3-5 ft an interviewer isn't going to notice that you're not looking directly at their eyes but directly above them, to him he thinks you're making great eye contact.\n\nToo perfect eye contact is just creepy though, make sure to change it up and glance elsewhere.\nREPLY 1 (1): Eye contact, though important, is merely a sign of confidence. Active listening goes hand-in-hand with eye contact and is the threshold to making a connection with some body.\nREPLY 1 (1): Yeah.  Also, don't masturbate or throw your shit at them either - can't believe that hasn't been mentioned either.\nREPLY 1 (0): Unless the interviewer has big tits\n\nIf she does, stare at them\n\nThat's why she grew them"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-77aiQEc18bPzitwks1y1KEcTy44Nk", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1682043786, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1823, "completion_tokens": 108, "total_tokens": 1931}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Reddit comment chain discusses the importance of eye contact in job interviews and social situations.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can you concisely summarize the main points for the Reddit comment chain that is pasted below?\nCOMMENT (647): I could write a lot on this from my recruitment days, but I'll just keep it to two main points.\n\n1. Answer their questions. Lots of people will start answering the question but never really finish because they go off on a tangent halfway through. It's frustrating as an interviewer to have to ask someone to get back on point, but it's also a little embarrassing for the candidate and it can throw you off your rhythm. I want to know the information because it's important. It also shows you listened to what was being asked of you and you delivered what was required.\n\n2. At the end of the interview, ask if they have any concerns about your resume, your interview answers or your application in general. It's a great way to see if there is anything they perhaps misunderstood or you didn't explain well enough. I've asked this in every interview and in all but one it's given me some immediate feedback and the ability to allay any concerns they might have. For example, I once had someone say I interviewed great but they were concerned I lived too far away, something that didn't come up in the interview. I was able to then say I would be relocating.\n\nEdit: as requested, a couple more things.\n\n3. Do interview prep before you go. You should be able to predict most of the questions, but just writing down what your strengths are and thinking about them will increase your confidence. Make notes on the company and role from the job description; how does that match up with your skills and experience? This crossover is important because it's usually why they will hire you.\n\n4. Take a notepad, for example the one you used for your interview notes. Make sure you ask if it's okay that you have your notes out, or if you can take notes during the interview. You won't always be able to do this because of a strict NDA, but that's why you ask. Good things to write down include the person's name since it can be easy to forget, especially if more than one person is interviewing you.\n\n5. Ask what the next steps are and when you might be hearing from them. Use your instincts when it comes to follow up. If you interviewed at retail and it went well, check in with the manager in a week and let them know you enjoyed your interview and you'll be available to start very soon if they pick you. But if you interview at a large company that specifically doesn't take phone calls then don't harass them. If I'm in HR you email me asking when you will hear, chances are I'm chasing the hiring manager for an answer too.\n\n6. Do not be scared of failure. If you perform poorly, you'll know it straight away and my best advice is just to take the rest of the day off and forget it. Then when you're feeling better try to figure out why it went poorly; bad preparation etc. I find a big one is the stress of getting somewhere new, where to park, who to ask for when I get there etc. Then work on these for the next interview.\n\nIf you did well and didn't get it, there was probably someone better. Don't take it personally. I've had to call great people and say no, and by and large the younger people took it rough and the older people took it on the chin.\n\nOn a personal note, I actually really enjoy interviews now. It's you on your own talking about yourself, who doesn't like doing that? If you dread it, it will probably not go as well as if you look forward to it. You have a captive audience listening to you telling them how great you are. How many times do you get that opportunity?\nREPLY 1 (23): Please do write more! This is really useful advice!\nREPLY 1 (4): Number 2! I actually read a similar suggestion somewhere on reddit when I was job hunting a while back. I asked that question in every interview and, like you, nearly every interviewer had feedback for me. I was interviewing for my first job out of college and a number of them asked if I would be able to handle a full time job since I had never had one before... I was definitely glad to have the opportunity to assure them that I am capable of working 40 hours a week! I think it's a very smart and thoughtful question to raise at the end of an interview. \nREPLY 1 (3): Man, I could have really used that advice (esp. #2) just two days ago. :/\nREPLY 1 (3): On point 1: If you have a hard time staying on point during an answer, practice repeating questions back to the interviewer. It doesn't have to be right away in the answer, but at some point during your answer repeat the words. If they ask \"What's your greatest weakness?\", at some point in your answer you repeat \"I think my greatest weakness is\" or some variation of that.\nREPLY 1 (6): I'm surprised to find your post six hours old with only my upvote. Your first point is basic but the second is gold. I can't wait to use that (hopefully in a few days, I just applied for a new position in my company).\nREPLY 2 (2): Yup.  This is a golden one that I've used to much success.\n\nI try to target it a bit more:  Is there anything you see or don't see in my resume that might prevent me from getting this position?\n\nYou'd be surprised at how often it gives you the opportunity for a last minute save.\nREPLY 1 (2): Good advice!\nREPLY 1 (2): I would add one point to this.  Dan, feel free to add to yours if you feel it's helpful.\n\n5. Do your research.  Research as much as you can about the position and the company you're interviewing with, and write that down.  Take it with you in your notebook.  Additionally, research your INTERVIEWERS.  LinkedIn is a great resource to find out your interviewers' past gigs, what they excel at, what makes them tick.  Then play to your audience.  Always get a list of names of folks who will be interviewing you before the interview so you can perform this prep work.  Again, write down key information about your interviewers in your notebook and try to remember things about them.  You can then bring them up in the interview.  Interviewers are usually pleasantly surprised to learn you've done your homework, especially about them.\nREPLY 2 (1): I can go both ways on this one. I see the value. And I know some agencies will provide this information to you as part of their prep. But I'm personally not sure, just because if I am the interviewer and the interviewee references my previous work experience or former colleagues, without me mentioning it first, I'd think it was a bit stalker-ish. But that's just my opinion.\nREPLY 3 (2): Interesting.  You're the first person I've encountered with that opinion.  It has served me well over the years, and those that know me and my background when coming into an interview are impressive to me.\nREPLY 4 (0): Yeah it's a personal thing I guess. I wouldn't specifically advise someone to do it, but I wouldn't specifically advise against it either.\nREPLY 1 (2): This post is gold.  I suck at interviews; I'll be following your advice for sure!\nREPLY 1 (2): This is great advice! Thanks! \nREPLY 1 (2): >For example, I once had someone say I interviewed great but they were concerned I lived too far away, something that didn't come up in the interview. I was able to then say I would be relocating.\n\nI'm pretty sure companies aren't allowed to discriminate against \"location\". Our HR explicitly told us to ignore their current location when hiring. Basically, if they are willing to do something ridiculous like a 6 hour commute every day, that's on them. As long as it doesn't affect their job performance, then we can't say or do anything about it (nor should we care for that matter).\nREPLY 2 (2): In my particular case, the job involved travelling to different locations (kind of like a sales rep). The concern was that I was on the edge of their serviceable area and wouldn't be able to make the required number of trips, so it was legitimate.\nREPLY 1 (2): and whats your advice if you don't know the time or location of the interview, but you know its that day... :(    \nEdit: I asked around and found the place but got there and hour early but they didn't seem to mind.\nREPLY 2 (1): An hour early is a hell of a lot better than an hour late. Hope it went well.\nREPLY 1 (2): Is it okay to ask the interviewer what they they thought about the interview?\nREPLY 2 (2): I think you'll get that feedback by asking if they have any concerns at the end of the interview. Remember there aren't really any 'rules' to interviews, at the end of the day you can do and say what you want. Some things work in some interviews, the same things won't work in others.\nREPLY 3 (2): Thank you. I posted this this and I would really appreciate your feedback. http://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1foqap/i_just_had_my_first_job_interview/\nREPLY 1 (2): DAAAAN AAAAAASHCROFT! ASHCROFT! ASHCROFT! ASHCROFT!\nREPLY 2 (4): I'M NOT A PREACHER MAN\nREPLY 3 (1): PREACH PREACH PREACH PREACH PREACH\nREPLY 1 (1): This was all helpful. Definitely didn't expect my reddit search of \"job interview\" to be so on point. I have a big interview tomorrow in Charleston, SC and will be applying these. Already wrote them down in my portfolio. Thanks a lot, seriously\nREPLY 2 (1): Good luck dude, I hope it goes well."}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-77aiQVuJ9JFXkMAsGzFViRw9GET5f", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1682043786, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2151, "completion_tokens": 115, "total_tokens": 2266}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Reddit comment chain provides tips for successful job interviews.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can you concisely summarize the main points for the Reddit comment chain that is pasted below?\nCOMMENT (246): I saw a similar post to this a few days ago, and actually just had a job interview today. So I decided to use some of the tips from that post that I thought would make an improvement on my 'being interviewed' skills. \n \n* Eye contact- In my first couple interviews I never really made a conscious effort to make eye contact with my interviewers. When I think back on it, I probably wasn't doing it nearly enough and could have made me look less confident. Today, I made a clear effort to look my interviewer in the eye when I spoke and I think it made a huge difference. \n\n* Be kind/sociable to those you meet before the interview - I made sure to put on whatever charm I could for the secretary, as well as another female employee in the front desk area. It actually turned into a nice 10 minute conversation, and without sounding too cocky, I think it helped me make a great first impression. If the people there can see themselves spending time in the office with you (i.e. working with you), it can only be a bonus for you. \n\n* Ask questions throughout the interview, not just at the end - I can see how this one wouldn't work for every type of interview, but I did this today because it seemed like it was the right thing to do. The result was the interview ended up being more of a conversation between me and the interviewer about a number of things. I can only assume this would make me/you standout from another typical question after question interview. \n\nI am still awaiting the results, but wish you the best of luck!\nREPLY 1 (27): As far as the \"be kind to those you meet before the interview\" thing, I can second this.\n\nBack in October I did a group interview for a firm a few hours away up near Chicago. Not being used to Chicago traffic, crowds, etc. I was a bit overwhelmed to say the least. Nonetheless, I pulled into the parking deck of my building pretty early (I left myself extra time to account for possible Chicago traffic which I didn't hit) and started heading to the office to try and find where I'd have to be interviewing.\n\nWhen I came up to the door, I held it open for the guy behind me because that's something I always do and after about 10 more steps he turned around and said \"You're in a suit... you here for the ________ interviews?\" which caught me off guard. Nonetheless, I told him I was and we started talking about firm and just had a casual conversation on the elevator ride up to the office and he wished me luck.\n\nWhen I walked in and they gave me schedule for the day, I recognized the name of my second interviewer as the man I had just met. When I walked into his office later we both had a quick laugh and then he told me that he saw huge potential in me just during our walk into the office and he was glad that he got to be the one to put in a good word for me.\n\nI got the job. You never know who you are going to meet or what sound advice they will be able to give you, so it is important to be nice to everybody you meet during the interview process.\nREPLY 1 (38): Have a dialogue, not an interrogation. \nREPLY 2 (1): Hard to do if you don't know how to have a dialog with someone you don't know well.\nREPLY 3 (1): You mistake me. It's not like you're having an actual conversation. It's that in an interview there's a degree of give and take. You want to know about the conditions under which you'll work and your employer wants to know about the conditions under which you'll work. \n\nI'm just saying don't be so passive that you never ask anything of your own. \nREPLY 1 (13): >\u2022Be kind/sociable to those you meet before the interview - I made sure to put on whatever charm I could for the secretary, as well as another female employee in the front desk area.\n\nThis is a great tip just for life.  If you work in an office, you will need everyone at some point, including and especially the secretaries and receptionists.  They go out of their way to help people they like, and so few people treat them as people with thoughts and feelings.\nREPLY 2 (2): The admin and support staff are usually they key people in the office when it comes to getting what you need/seeing who you want.  They usually know everything and have the ear of everybody important.  I worked with a guy who was always ranting about how he made so much more money than everybody but the president and how he could have all the admins fired at his will.  And then he could never figure out why he couldn't get what he needed when he needed it.  Always be kind and friendly with the office support staff.  They run the place.\nREPLY 1 (27): ohhh good luck! let us know if you got it \n\nREPLY 2 (1): Thanks!\nREPLY 2 (1): OP will surely deliver!\nREPLY 2 (1): Just curious, why did you post this on a throwaway?\nREPLY 3 (2): forgot i was logged in on a throw away...now that you point it out i realize ive been posting under this one for a while now...opse. \nREPLY 4 (1): Yeah, I looked back through your comments and I didn't notice anything scandlous so I was confused. Enjoy the orangred when you get back, friend!\nREPLY 1 (2): Can you give some examples of questions you asked?\nREPLY 2 (9): \"For this position, what would a typical day entail?\"\n\n\"What are the responsibilities I'd be expected to assume?\"\n\n\"Who will I be working with? How much of my time will be spent in a group vs on my own?\"\n\nThings like that are always good. They show that you're really looking at how you would fit in, without seeming desperate at all.\nREPLY 3 (3): Yeah these are all great examples, especially at the end. The questions I asked during the interview were all mostly job specific, so those kind of questions would vary depending on whatever field you were looking to get into. \n\nOne question at the end that I asked, that another redditor suggested I ask was \"What are some immediate and sustainable contributions you are looking for in this position?\" That one seemed to be a great conversation starter as well. \nREPLY 3 (1): Thank you! :)\nREPLY 1 (2): YES! Second tip, always be nice to the receptionist / secretary! Flash a big smile, a happy \"Good morning, how you doing?\". These people see your potential boss every single day.\nREPLY 1 (2): If it's hard for you to make eye contact stare between their eyebrows, looks the same to the person and isn't as creepy on your end.\nREPLY 1 (2): One other thing is to have a small smile while you speak. It will make you sound much more enthusiastic about the job or whatever you are being asked. I had a phone interview last year and my job was in another city, this helped me stay relaxed. \n\nGood luck on getting your job btw! \nREPLY 2 (1): Thank ya!\n\nREPLY 1 (2): The friendly and sociable part are the most important. You're not called into an interview to see if you can do the job. You're called in to see if you're crazy or not. \nREPLY 1 (2): >Be kind/sociable to those you meet before the interview\n\nI am one of those people at the front. Seriously... be nice, social and friendly! I'll put in a great word and say \"I really think this person will fit in here!\".\n\nREPLY 2 (1): Yes! My mom is also a secretary and has called me and mentioned people that came into work for interviews and what she thought of them. (Not in a creepy way.) You want to be the *good* kind of memorable, not the bad!\nREPLY 3 (1): I always talk to the HR manager after someone comes in. One time I had a guy almost fall asleep in the reception area and was burping like crazy!! I didn't say anything about him but he did end up getting fired eventually.\nREPLY 1 (1): What kind of questions did you ask?\nREPLY 2 (2): What cup size are you?\nREPLY 1 (1): I can never think of any questions :(\nREPLY 1 (1): > made sure to put on whatever charm I could for the secretary, as well as another female employee in the front desk area.\n\nWorks even better if the secretary is male.\nREPLY 1 (1): Conversation is a very, very good sign. Good luck. \nREPLY 1 (1): \"Be kind/sociable to those you meet before the interview\"\n\n-Absolutely this! My boss does a lot of interviewing and I am the first point of contact when candidates arrive. It is actually in our interview agenda for me to interact with the candidates first. I don't formally interview, just try to have a casual conversation with them as I am escorting them through the building to get a feel of personality and to see if they actually interact with me. After the interviews my boss always asks for my feedback. To this day he has always hired the person I recommended.  \n\nEdit: Good luck to you! \nREPLY 1 (1): Great point about asking questions throughout.  It's a great way to get around a tricky question or give yourself more time to think. \nREPLY 1 (1): You didn't get the job\n\nThe hiring manager said the interview seemed contrived\n\nLike you read a bunch of tips off the internet or something\nREPLY 1 (1): What kind of questions should you ask during the interview?\nREPLY 1 (1): Did you get the job?"}]}, {"id": "chatcmpl-77aiQkxb6PHQu95a4EOiUbdAZtDy2", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1682043786, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2127, "completion_tokens": 151, "total_tokens": 2278}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The original poster used tips from a previous post to improve their interview skills, including making eye contact, being kind and sociable to those before the interview, and asking questions throughout the interview.
